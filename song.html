    <p>It was just two lovers, sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde</p>
    <p>Fallin' for each other, pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish</p>
    <p>No Donald Glover, missed call from my mother</p>
    <p>Like, "Where you at tonight?" Got no alibi</p>
    <br>
    <p>I was all alone with the love of my life</p>
    <p>She's got glitter for skin, my radiant beam in the night</p>
    <p>I don't need no light to see you</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Shine</p>
    <p>It's your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)</p>
    <p>You slow down time</p>
    <p>In your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)</p>
    <br>
    <p>We were just two lovers, feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast</p>
    <p>Burnin' through the summer, radio on blast, make the moment last</p>
    <p>She got solar power, minutes feel like hours</p>
    <p>She knew she was the baddest, can you even imagine</p>
    <br>
    <p>Fallin' like I did for the love of my life?</p>
    <p>She's got glow on her face, a glorious look in her eyes</p>
    <p>My angel of light</p>
    <br>
    <p>I was all alone with the love of my life</p>
    <p>She's got glitter for skin, my radiant beam in the night</p>
    <p>I don't need no light to see you</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Shine</p>
    <p>It's your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)</p>
    <p>You slow down time</p>
    <p>In your golden hour (oh-ooh-oh)</p>
